Story: Jack built a WordPress theme with View.js and wants to offer it for free on WordPress.org's theme repository. Jack needs the extended license. If Jack chooses to sell another theme, he should buy the extended license again, for that theme.

By purchasing View.js, you agree to the following: View.js remain property of Rogie King. View.js may be used by the licensee in any personal or commercial projects. View.js may be resold or redistributed in one single project or application where it could be downloaded for free, where View.js is bundled along with other files.

Unless you have our prior written consent, you must not directly or indirectly license, sub-license, sell or resell or provide for free View.js or offer to do any of these things unless View.js is incorporated into a work you have created. All of these things are referred to as Resale.

For example, with an Extended License, View.js could be used in:

    A personal website
    A commercial website
    One single website theme for resale
    One single web application for resale
